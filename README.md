<h1> Active Directory Detection & Security </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to demonstrate the secure configuration of a newly deployed Active Directory environment using firewall restriction, group policies and detection using Splunk SIEM to analyse logs.</b>

<br>To achieve this, we will design a simple lab, build, create users, group policies and effect monitoring using Splunk SIEM.
