<h1> Active Directory Detection & Security </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The aim of this project is to showcase how a newly deployed Active Directory is vulnerable to certain attacks and how to properly detect and mitigate those attacks.</b>
To achieve this, we will design a simple lab, build and then perform internal pentesting against the domain controller.
